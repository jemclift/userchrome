# My Firefox Style Sheet

Some subtle adjustments to the Firefox chrome (and some site specific changes)

### How to install

1. Turn on user stylesheets in [about:config](about:config) by setting the flag `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true` (double click)
2. Find your profile directory, the path should be in [about:profiles](about:profiles)
3. Make a folder there called `chrome` and put your css file in it.
4. Restart Firefox to see the changes
